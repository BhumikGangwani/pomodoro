# Pomodoro
A pomodoro timer I created to help myself be a little productive.


## Setup
Clone this repository to a local directory. Refer to [GitHub Pages](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository) for more guidance.

Next, you should install the neccessary packages to run **main.py**: *tkinter,* and *winsound*. You can install these using **pip**:
```
- pip install tkinter
```
```
- pip install winsound
```

Now your setup is completed!

## Running the Code
To run the code, run **main.py**. This will open up a tkinter window with the timer displayed on the screen.

You can use the interactive buttons to start, stop, or skip the timer.

That is essentially all you need to know to take a leap towards productivity!

## Future Plans
- Incorporate a widget that keeps track of the tasks that the user needs to work on.
- Store the session report for the user by uploading the progress to a pixela tracker.
